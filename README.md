# 🏨 Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis

##  Project Overview
This project performs an end-to-end data analysis on hotel booking data to understand **why customers cancel bookings** and how hotels can reduce **revenue loss and operational inefficiency**.

Using Python for exploratory data analysis, the project identifies key cancellation drivers related to **pricing, booking channels, hotel type, and geography**, and provides actionable business recommendations.

##  Business Problem
Hotels face significant revenue loss due to high booking cancellation rates. Cancelled bookings often result in empty rooms, poor capacity planning, and inefficient pricing decisions.

**Core question:**  
*How can historical booking data be used to identify the main drivers of cancellations and support better business decisions?*

##  Objectives
- Analyze booking cancellation patterns  
- Identify key factors influencing cancellations  
- Compare City Hotels vs Resort Hotels  
- Understand booking channel and country-wise behavior  
- Provide actionable, data-driven recommendations  

---

##  Key Insights
- City Hotels have higher cancellation rates than Resort Hotels  
- Higher room prices (ADR) are associated with more cancellations  
- Around **50% of bookings come through Online Travel Agents (OTAs)**  
- **OTAs have the highest cancellation rates** among all booking channels  
- **Portugal shows the highest cancellation levels**, indicating regional risk

##  Business Recommendations
- Improve accuracy and transparency of OTA listings  
- Encourage direct bookings to reduce OTA dependency  
- Apply dynamic and region-specific pricing strategies  
- Introduce non-refundable or semi-flexible pricing options  
- Closely monitor high-risk regions such as Portugal
