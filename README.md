# 🏨 Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs an end-to-end data analysis on hotel booking data to understand **why customers cancel bookings** and how hotels can reduce **revenue loss and operational inefficiency**.

Using Python for exploratory data analysis, the project identifies key cancellation drivers related to **pricing, booking channels, hotel type, and geography**, and provides actionable business recommendations.

## ❗ Business Problem
Hotels face significant revenue loss due to high booking cancellation rates. Cancelled bookings often result in empty rooms, poor capacity planning, and inefficient pricing decisions.

**Core question:**  
*How can historical booking data be used to identify the main drivers of cancellations and support better business decisions?*
